# Heart_Disease_Prediction
The Heart Disease Prediction project utilizes logistic regression to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. It aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis of heart-related conditions.
The code provides an overview of the logistic regression and random forest classification models' accuracy and generates a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset
The dataset (framingham.csv) is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). 

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Selection: Select relevant features from the dataset that contribute significantly to heart disease prediction.

Logistic Regression: Implement logistic regression algorithm to model the probability of heart disease occurrence based on the selected features.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, and train the logistic regression model using the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in new patients.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
