# Heart_Disease_Prediction
The dataset (framingham.csv) is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). 
The code provides an overview of the logistic regression and random forest classification models' accuracy and generates a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
